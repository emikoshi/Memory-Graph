GOALS:
graph each instance of the object
each pointer is a reference to an object
each "thing" has this basic structure

struct thing {
	string name
	int type
	ArrayList<thing> connected[]
}

each different type has its own color and shape to make it more readable


FAR REACHING GOALS:
1) possibly make it dynamic (real time analysis)
2) thicker border for more memory
3) add "click through" functionality
	- click on an item to recieve more details
	- address in memory
	- connected data addresses
	- memory allocation size
